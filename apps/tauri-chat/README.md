# Tauri Chat Skeleton

This folder contains a minimal skeleton for a Tauri-based chat UI.
It is a placeholder showing recommended structure; it does not install Tauri toolchain.

Structure:
- `src/` : frontend static files (HTML/JS)
- `src/main.html` : simple chat UI to call backend `/chat`

To develop, install Tauri prerequisites and adapt the scripts.
